# ToDo-List 

This todo-list project allows users to add, edit, and delete items on their list. It is built using JavaScript and EJS, which enables the list to be dynamic and interactive. The list is stored in a database and is displayed on the page using EJS templates.

Users can add new items to the list by typing them into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. They can also mark items as complete by clicking the checkbox next to the item. Completed items are struck-through and moved to the bottom of the list.

If a user needs to edit an item, they can click the "Edit" button next to the item and make their changes in the input field. The updated item will be saved to the database and displayed on the list.

Finally, users can delete items from the list by clicking the "Delete" button next to the item. The item will be removed from the database and the list will be updated to reflect the change.

Overall, this todo-list provides an easy and convenient way for users to manage their tasks and stay organized.
